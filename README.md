# Portfolio 

Here's my portfolio, created as Udacity's "Frontend Developer Nanodegree" project and then improved little by little.
I've used my HTML and CSS skills to build a full responsive website

## Responsiveness 

This portfolio is 100% responisve for all the devices. There are major and minor breakpoint for 4 main screen sizes:

- smartphone
- phablet
